{
  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core arguments and key points from the source text, including the importance of evaluation, key metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), and challenges like bias and non-determinism. However, it omits some minor details (e.g., the specific 'ArXiv paper' reference) and paraphrases technical terms (e.g., 'recursive thought expansion' → 'show its work'). No factual errors are present."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is well-structured, logically flowing from evaluation importance to metrics to nuanced challenges. The tone is consistent (informal yet professional), and transitions are smooth. The conclusion ties everything together neatly."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary avoids fluff and focuses on critical points, but it could be slightly more succinct (e.g., some illustrative analogies like 'squirrel court judge' add color but slightly extend length). Redundancy is minimal."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary comprehensively covers the most critical aspects of the source text, including safety, compliance, metrics, human evaluation, and nuanced capabilities. Only minor details (e.g., specific compliance laws) are omitted, which are tangential to the main thesis."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellent—highly faithful, coherent, and concise with excellent coverage. It would benefit from minor trimming for absolute succinctness but is otherwise outstanding."
