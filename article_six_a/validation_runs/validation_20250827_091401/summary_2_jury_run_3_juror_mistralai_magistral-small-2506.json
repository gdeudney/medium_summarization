{
  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures all critical points from the source text, including the necessity of rigorous evaluation, the role of automated and human metrics, and the importance of addressing safety, bias, and non-determinism. Key examples (e.g., 'biking to the moon', 'more cowbell') are preserved, and technical details (e.g., BERTScore, CoT prompting) are correctly summarized."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is well-structured, with clear sections (e.g., 'Why Bother?', 'Automated Metrics') mirroring the source. Logical flow is maintained, and transitions between ideas (e.g., from metrics to LLM-as-judge) are smooth. The tone matches the original, balancing humor ('digital gremlins') with technical depth."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary avoids redundancy and fluff, but some sentences could be tighter (e.g., 'This is where evaluation literally saves the day' â†’ 'Evaluation saves the day'). However, it efficiently condenses dense material (e.g., all metrics, compliance, and non-determinism) without losing nuance."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "All major points from the source are included: safety, compliance, automated metrics (BLEU, F1), LLM-as-judge, human evaluation, intrinsic/extrinsic tests, and beyond-core topics (bias, reliability, cost). The 'Conclusion' synthesizes the argument perfectly."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is a masterful condensation of the original. It achieves flawless faithfulness and coverage, near-flawless coherence, and strong conciseness. It could be marginally more concise but loses nothing in accuracy or clarity."
