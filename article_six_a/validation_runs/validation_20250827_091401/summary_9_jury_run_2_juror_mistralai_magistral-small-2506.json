{
  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures all critical points from the original text, including the importance of evaluation, specific metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, etc.), nuanced capabilities (planning, bias), and practical considerations (cost, observability). No factual inaccuracies or omissions."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is well-structured, logically flowing from why evaluation matters to methods (automated, LLM-as-judge, human) and beyond. The tone matches the original’s conversational yet technical style, with consistent humor (squirrels, cowbell)."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary distills ~3000 words into ~800 words without losing key details. Redundancy is minimal; terms like 'multi-method' and 'multi-faceted' elegantly summarize complex ideas. The example of 'spaghetti vs. stomachs' succinctly explains extrinsic evaluation."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "All major topics from the original are included: safety, compliance, metrics (BLEU, METEOR), LLM-as-judge, bias, non-determinism, and human evaluation. Even niche concepts like RTE/HTD are briefly mentioned. Missing minor examples (e.g., exact 'more cowbell' phrasing) but retains the core message."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "Flawless. The summary is a perfect condensing of the original’s content, style, and intent, achieving 5/5 across all criteria."
