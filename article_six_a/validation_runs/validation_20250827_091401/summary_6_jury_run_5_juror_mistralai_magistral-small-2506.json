{
  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the original text's core arguments, including the necessity of rigorous evaluation, the role of automated and human metrics, and the risks of over-reliance on single evaluation methods. However, it slightly paraphrases some phrases (e.g., 'Digital Darwin Awards' vs. original phrasing) and omits minor details like the 'non-squirrel-powered centrifuge' example, but these are negligible and do not affect the main points."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary is well-structured, with clear sections mirroring the original's organization (thesis, key metrics, nuances, beyond core metrics, conclusion). Transitions between sections are logical, and the flow is easy to follow. The use of headings enhances readability."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary is succinct, avoiding redundancy while preserving the original's depth. It omits tangential humor (e.g., 'more cowbell' jokes) and condenses complex ideas (e.g., RTE/HTD explanations) without losing clarity. Some minor details (e.g., 'Franken-Rig') are omitted for brevity but do not detract from the core message."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary comprehensively covers all critical points from the original: the necessity of evaluation, automated metrics (BLEU, F1, etc.), LLM-as-judge methods, nuanced capabilities (planning, feedback), and beyond-metrics concerns (bias, cost, observability). No major points are missed."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellent, scoring 4 or 5 across all criteria. It maintains high faithfulness, coherence, conciseness, and coverage, omitting only minor, non-essential details. The structure and clarity make it a reliable reference for the original text."
