  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures all key points from the original text, including technical terms (e.g., BERTScore, CoT), metaphors (*Digital Darwin Awards*, *spaghetti and stomachs*), and the central thesis on evaluation's necessity. No factual inaccuracies or omissions are present."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is well-structured, logically flowing from evaluation necessity to methodologies (automated metrics, LLM-as-judge, human evaluation) and beyond-core considerations. The tone mirrors the original's punchy humor while maintaining clarity."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary eliminates fluff without losing nuance. It condenses complex ideas (e.g., intrinsic vs. extrinsic evaluation) into succinct phrases and retains only the most critical details, avoiding redundancy."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "Every major point from the original is included: why evaluation matters (safety, compliance, efficiency), key metrics, LLM-as-judge methods, human evaluation, and beyond-core aspects (bias, non-determinism, user satisfaction). No critical omission exists."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is flawless. It achieves the rare balance of being both exhaustive (coverage) and succinct (conciseness), with perfect adherence to the original's content (faithfulness) and style (coherence)."
