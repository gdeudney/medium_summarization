{
  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the original text's main arguments, tone, and key examples (e.g., 'spaghetti and stomachs,' 'more cowbell'). It preserves technical terms (BLEU, BERTScore) and critical nuances like non-determinism and intrinsic/extrinsic evaluation. No factual errors are introduced."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is logically structured and flows naturally, mirroring the original's punchy, metaphor-rich style. Sentences are well-connected (e.g., transitioning from metrics to human evaluation). The tone remains consistent and engaging."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary condenses the original effectively but occasionally retains slightly redundant phrasing (e.g., 'smooth-talking digital gremlin' and 'good liar' are similar). Some metaphorical examples (e.g., 'squirrel court judge') add color but could be trimmed for brevity without losing meaning."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "All major sections of the original (safety, compliance, metrics, human evaluation, etc.) are included. Critical points like non-determinism, bias/fairness, and user satisfaction are preserved. The summary avoids omitting any central themes or evidence."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellentâ€”factually accurate, coherent, and comprehensive. Minor conciseness tweaks (e.g., reducing repeated metaphors) could slightly improve readability, but it stands as a strong, faithful representation of the original."
