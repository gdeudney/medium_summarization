    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the main points of the original text, including the importance of evaluation for safety, compliance, and quality, as well as the various metrics and methodologies discussed.

    "rank": 5,

  },
  "conciseness": {

  "coverage": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the essential aspects of the original text, including the reasons for evaluation, metrics, methodologies, and other evaluation aspects.
