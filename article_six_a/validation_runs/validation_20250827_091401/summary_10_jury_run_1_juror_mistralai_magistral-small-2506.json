{
  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core arguments and evidence from the original source, including specific metrics (e.g., F1-Score, BERTScore), safety concerns, and compliance needs. It avoids misrepresenting or omitting critical details, though minor paraphrases slightly soften the original's colloquial tone."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is logically structured, with clear transitions between sections (e.g., metrics → LLM-as-judge → human evaluation). The language is precise and avoids redundancy, making it easy to follow even for readers unfamiliar with the topic."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary distills 20+ pages of content into essential points without fluff. Technical terms (e.g., RTE, HTD) are briefly explained, and examples (e.g., 'squirrel-themed hotels') maintain brevity and clarity."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers 95% of key themes (safety, metrics, human evaluation) but omits deeper dives into explainability (e.g., input attribution) and the 'digital non-determinism' tangent, which were minor in the original."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellent: faithful, coherent, and concise, with near-exhaustive coverage of critical points. Minor omissions and slight softening of tone cost it a perfect score."
