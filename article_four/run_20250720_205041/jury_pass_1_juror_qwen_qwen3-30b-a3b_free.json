{
  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects all key facts from the source texts. It correctly states that the Curiosity Rover found evidence of ancient megafloods (Article 1), long-lasting lakes and river systems (Article 2), and sediment layer analysis confirming flooding (Article 3). It also properly links these findings to the hypothesis of a thicker Martian atmosphere and liquid water (Article 3), without introducing contradictions or fabrications."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is logically structured, with clear connections between ideas. It flows smoothly from the discovery of megafloods to the confirmation of lakes/rivers, then to sediment analysis and the broader implications for Mars' habitability. The sentence is well-constructed and easy to follow."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is perfectly succinct, with no redundant or irrelevant details. Each phrase directly contributes to conveying the core findings and implications from the source texts, such as 'significant water activity,' 'triggered by meteor impacts,' and 'thicker atmosphere and conditions capable of sustaining liquid water.'"
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "All critical points from the source texts are fully captured. The summary includes ancient megafloods (Article 1), long-lasting lakes/rivers (Article 2), sediment layer analysis (Article 3), the hypothesis of a thicker atmosphere, and the connection to Mars' past habitability (Article 3). No essential information is omitted."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is factually accurate, well-structured, succinct, and comprehensive, perfectly aligning with the source texts without omissions or distortions."
