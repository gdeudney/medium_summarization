  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the source text's core arguments and key points without introducing fabrications or contradictions. It correctly identifies the necessity of rigorous evaluation for safety, compliance, and real-world alignment, and accurately describes the limitations of automated metrics (e.g., BLEU/ROUGE missing nuance, BERTScore using contextual embeddings). It also correctly captures the LLM-as-a-judge methodology, intrinsic/extrinsic evaluation distinction, and additional considerations like bias, reliability, and observability. No factual errors or hallucinations are present."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exceptionally clear, well-structured, and fluent. It follows a logical flow: central thesis → key supporting points → additional considerations → conclusion. Each section is labeled with numbered points and subpoints, making the hierarchy of ideas easy to follow. The language is consistent and avoids awkward phrasing, maintaining a professional tone that mirrors the source text's explanatory style."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is perfectly succinct, with no redundant or irrelevant details. It condenses the source text's lengthy explanations into precise, focused statements (e.g., 'BLEU focuses on n-gram overlap' instead of elaborating on the cucumber vs. doorbell analogy). Each concept is described with minimal word count while retaining essential meaning, and all critical elements from the source are included without unnecessary elaboration."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary comprehensively captures all major sections of the source text: safety/compliance, automated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore), LLM-as-a-judge methodology, nuanced capabilities (planning, personalization, feedback refinement), intrinsic/extrinsic evaluation, and additional considerations (bias, reliability, efficiency, observability, user relevance). It even reflects the conclusion's emphasis on holistic evaluation strategies. While some specific anecdotes (e.g., 'squirrel-adjacent intro') are omitted, the critical technical and conceptual points are fully represented."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is a flawless, coherent, and concise representation of the source text's content. It accurately captures all essential arguments, methodologies, and evaluation criteria without adding or omitting critical information. Its structure mirrors the source's logical progression, and its language is precise and free of redundancy. It meets the highest standards across all evaluation criteria."
