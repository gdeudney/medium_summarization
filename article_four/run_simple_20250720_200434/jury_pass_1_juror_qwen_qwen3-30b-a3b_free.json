  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects all key facts from the source texts. It correctly states the Mars Curiosity Rover's discovery of ancient megafloods (Article 1), the geological layers indicating long-lasting lakes and rivers (Article 2), and sediment analysis confirming intense flooding (Article 3). It also aligns with Article 3's mention of a thicker atmosphere and liquid water, without introducing contradictions or fabrications."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is logically structured, with clear transitions between ideas. It connects the rover's findings on megafloods, geological layers, and sediment studies to the broader implications about Mars' habitability, maintaining a smooth and understandable flow without ambiguity or disjointedness."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is succinct, containing no redundant or extraneous information. Each sentence directly conveys a critical point from the source texts, such as the timing of megafloods, the role of geological layers, sediment studies, and the implications for Mars' atmosphere and habitability."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "All three source texts are fully represented. The summary captures the megafloods (Article 1), long-lasting water systems (Article 2), and sediment evidence with atmospheric implications (Article 3). It also synthesizes the core conclusion about Mars' habitable past, ensuring no major ideas are omitted."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is flawless in its faithfulness, coherence, conciseness, and coverage, accurately and efficiently conveying all critical information from the source texts without omissions or inaccuracies."
