  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects all key facts from the three source articles: it correctly cites the 'Nature Communications' study and the University of Vienna research, accurately describes the blood-brain barrier crossing (in mice) and rapid accumulation, and correctly notes the ongoing investigation into health risks with links to inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. There are no hallucinations or factual inaccuracies."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exceptionally clear, well-structured, and fluent. It follows a logical flow: introducing the studies, explaining the barrier crossing and accumulation, specifying the ingestion method, and concluding with the health implications and ongoing research. The language is precise and easy to understand."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is perfectly succinct. It includes only the essential information from the source texts without any unnecessary elaboration or redundant phrases. Every word contributes to conveying the core findings and implications."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures all the most critical points from the three source articles: the specific studies (Nature Communications, University of Vienna), the key findings (blood-brain barrier crossing, rapid accumulation, ingestion route), the human relevance (concerns about neurological effects), and the status of health risk research (ongoing investigation, links to inflammation/diseases)."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is an excellent representation of the source materials, demonstrating high performance across all evaluation criteria."
