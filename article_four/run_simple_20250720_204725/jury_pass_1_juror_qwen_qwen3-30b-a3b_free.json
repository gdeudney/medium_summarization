{
  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects all factual claims from the source texts. It correctly states the Mars Curiosity Rover's discovery of ancient megafloods (Article 1), the geological layers indicating long-lasting lakes/rivers (Article 2), and sediment studies confirming intense flooding with implications about Mars' atmosphere and habitability (Article 3). No contradictions or fabrications are present."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exceptionally clear and logically structured. It connects the findings from the three articles in a seamless flow, starting with megafloods, moving to water presence via geological layers, and concluding with atmospheric and habitability implications. The sentences are well-organized and easy to follow."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is perfectly succinct. Every sentence directly addresses key points from the sources without redundancy or filler. It combines information from all three articles efficiently, using precise language like 'uncovered evidence,' 'analysis of geological layers,' and 'supported by sediment studies' to convey core ideas succinctly."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary comprehensively captures all critical points from the source texts. It includes the timing of megafloods (4 billion years ago), the cause (meteor impacts melting ice), the presence of lakes/rivers (millions of years), sediment layer analysis, and the implications for Mars' atmosphere and habitability. All essential concepts from the three articles are represented."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is flawless in its faithfulness, coherence, conciseness, and coverage, accurately synthesizing all key information from the source texts without omission or distortion."
