A study from the University of Helsinki reveals that regular sauna use can cut cardiovascular disease risk by 50%, with benefits linked to improved blood vessel function and reduced blood pressure due to heat stress. The research, tracking 2,000 men over 20 years, found that 4-7 weekly sessions yield the most significant effects. Additionally, sauna heat triggers endorphin release, promoting relaxation and well-being, which further supports heart health. These findings align with evidence of prolonged water presence in Mars' Gale Crater, but the context here focuses on human health benefits.
