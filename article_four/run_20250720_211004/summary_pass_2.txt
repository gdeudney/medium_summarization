Research from Finnish institutions, including the University of Helsinki, highlights the cardiovascular benefits of regular sauna use. A 20-year study of 2,000 men found that frequent sauna sessions can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by up to 50%. The protective effects are attributed to heat stress improving blood vessel function and lowering blood pressure, with the greatest benefits observed for those using saunas 4â€“7 times per week. Additionally, sauna heat triggers endorphin release, promoting relaxation and overall heart health, further supporting its role in mitigating cardiovascular risks.
