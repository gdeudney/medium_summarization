  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects all factual elements from the source text: it correctly attributes the study to Finnish institutions (including the University of Helsinki), mentions the 20-year study of 2,000 men, states the 50% risk reduction for cardiovascular disease, explains the mechanisms (heat stress improving blood vessel function and lowering blood pressure), notes the 4â€“7 sessions per week frequency, and includes the endorphin release and relaxation aspect. No contradictions or fabrications are present."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exceptionally clear and well-structured. It logically connects the study's findings, mechanisms, and implications in a seamless flow. Each sentence builds on the previous one, maintaining a natural progression from the study's context to its results and supporting details. The language is fluent and easy to understand."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is perfectly succinct, with no redundant or irrelevant details. It condenses all critical information from the source text into a compact form, ensuring every sentence directly contributes to conveying the study's key points without unnecessary elaboration."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures all essential concepts from the source text: the study's institution, methodology (20-year follow-up of 2,000 men), risk reduction percentage, mechanisms (blood vessel function, blood pressure, endorphins), and the frequency-dependent benefits. It includes all main ideas and nuances without omission."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary excels in faithfulness, coherence, conciseness, and coverage, accurately and efficiently reflecting the source text's findings and structure without errors or omissions."
