  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the core findings from all three source articles: the discovery of ancient megafloods, the role of meteor impacts, the existence of long-lasting water bodies, the geological evidence from sediment layers, the implications for Mars' thicker atmosphere, and the connection to past habitability. There are no fabricated details or contradictions with the source texts."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exceptionally clear, well-structured, and fluent. It logically progresses from the main discovery (megafloods) to supporting details (meteor impacts, sediment layers) and broader implications (atmosphere, habitability). The sentence structure is smooth and easy to follow."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is perfectly succinct. It eliminates all fluff and redundancy, presenting only the essential information derived from the source texts. Every word contributes to conveying the key findings and their significance."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures all the most critical points from the three source articles: the evidence of megafloods, the geological timeline (millions of years), the role of meteor impacts, the confirmation via sediment analysis, the atmospheric conditions, and the link to past habitability. No essential concepts or main ideas are omitted."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is an excellent, accurate, and comprehensive representation of the source texts. It effectively condenses the key findings while maintaining clarity and precision."
