{
  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects all factual claims from the source texts. It correctly states that the Curiosity Rover found evidence of ancient megafloods (Article 1), long-lasting lakes/rivers (Article 2), and sediment layer analysis confirming flooding (Article 3). The connection between flooding and meteor impacts, as well as the implications for Mars' atmosphere and habitability, align with the original texts without introducing contradictions or fabrications."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exceptionally clear and logically structured. It flows smoothly by connecting findings (megafloods, lakes, sediment layers) to their implications (thicker atmosphere, habitability). Each sentence builds on the previous one, maintaining a natural progression of ideas without ambiguity or disjointedness."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is perfectly succinct, with no redundant or filler content. Every phrase directly contributes to conveying the core findings and implications from the source texts, such as 'intense flooding events' and 'conditions capable of sustaining liquid water' without unnecessary elaboration."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "All critical points from the original texts are fully captured. The summary includes the discovery of megafloods (Article 1), long-lasting water systems (Article 2), sediment layer analysis (Article 3), and the hypothesis about Mars' atmosphere and habitability (Article 3). No essential information is omitted or misrepresented."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is factually accurate, well-structured, succinct, and comprehensive, perfectly aligning with the original source texts without omissions or errors."
