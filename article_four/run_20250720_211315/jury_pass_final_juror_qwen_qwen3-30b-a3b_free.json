  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the core content of the original text without introducing fabrications or contradictions. It correctly identifies the importance of robust evaluation for effectiveness, safety, and ethical use, and accurately lists the key methodologies (automated metrics, LLM-as-a-judge, human evaluation) and additional considerations (bias, reliability, efficiency, observability, user satisfaction). All critical points from the source are preserved, including the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation, the role of metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, and the emphasis on avoiding harmful outputs and regulatory risks."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exceptionally clear, well-structured, and fluent. It logically organizes the evaluation criteria into distinct categories (e.g., automated metrics, LLM-as-a-judge, human evaluation) and transitions smoothly between sections. The flow mirrors the original text's progression, maintaining a logical sequence that connects technical evaluation methods with broader ethical and practical considerations. No awkward or disjointed phrasing is present."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is perfectly succinct, with no redundant or filler content. It distills the original text's extensive explanations into a compact overview, retaining all essential concepts without unnecessary elaboration. For example, it condenses the original's humorous analogies (e.g., 'digital gremlins,' 'squirrel court') into precise, factual statements while maintaining clarity. Every sentence serves a purpose, avoiding verbose descriptions of examples or tangential details."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures all critical points and main ideas from the original text. It includes the rationale for evaluation (safety, compliance, user experience), the breakdown of automated metrics (accuracy, F1-score, BLEU/ROUGE, BERTScore), the LLM-as-a-judge approach, human evaluation, intrinsic/extrinsic evaluation, bias mitigation, reliability, efficiency, observability, and user-centric factors. While it omits specific anecdotes (e.g., 'squirrel-adjacent intro,' 'more cowbell'), these are secondary details. The summary retains the essential technical and conceptual framework of the source."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is faithful, coherent, concise, and comprehensive, accurately reflecting the key evaluation metrics and methodologies discussed in the original text."
