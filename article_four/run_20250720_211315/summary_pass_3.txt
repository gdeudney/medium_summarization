Recent studies highlight the potential for plastic nanoparticles to enter the brain and cause harm. Research in *Nature Communications* shows these particles can cross the blood-brain barrier in mice, while University of Vienna scientists found that ingestion through food and water leads to accumulation in the brain within two hours. Though further investigation is needed, preliminary evidence links nanoplastic exposure to risks such as inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring concerns about long-term health impacts from environmental plastic contamination.
