Recent studies, including one published in *Nature Communications* and research from the University of Vienna, reveal that plastic nanoparticles can cross the blood-brain barrier in mice and accumulate in the brain within two hours of ingestion through food or water. These findings, which highlight the potential for rapid entry into the brain, raise concerns about possible neurological effects in humans. While the exact health risks of microplastic and nanoplastic exposure remain under investigation, preliminary evidence suggests a link to inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases.
