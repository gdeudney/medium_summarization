The Mars Curiosity Rover has uncovered evidence in Gale Crater of ancient megafloods approximately 4 billion years ago, likely caused by meteor impacts melting ice deposits. Analysis of geological layers also suggests the presence of long-lasting lakes and river systems, indicating water existed for millions of years. These findings, supported by sediment studies, reinforce the idea that early Mars had a thicker atmosphere and conditions potentially suitable for life.
