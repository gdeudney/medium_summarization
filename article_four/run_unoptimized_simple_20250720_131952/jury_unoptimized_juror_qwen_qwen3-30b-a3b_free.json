  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the original text's core arguments and details without introducing fabrications. It correctly captures the emphasis on evaluation's role in safety, compliance, quality, and efficiency, and includes all key metrics (accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, perplexity, BERTScore) and methodologies (LLM-as-a-judge, intrinsic/extrinsic evaluation, bias audits, reliability, observability, user satisfaction). Specific examples like 'digital Darwin Awards' and 'squirrel-powered centrifuge' are omitted, but these are illustrative anecdotes rather than critical factual claims. No contradictions or hallucinations are present."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exceptionally clear, well-structured, and fluent. It organizes content into logical sections (Why Evaluation Matters, Core Metrics, Nuanced Capabilities, etc.) with consistent numbering and subpoints. The flow follows the original text's progression, and the language is direct and easy to follow. While the original text uses informal tone and humor, the summary maintains a professional structure without sacrificing clarity or logical connections between ideas."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is perfectly succinct, with no redundant or irrelevant details. Each section distills the original text's key points into precise, actionable summaries. For example, it condenses the 'LLM-as-a-judge' methodology into a single paragraph without losing essential mechanics (pairwise comparisons, direct scoring, critique generation). The conversational examples from the original (e.g., 'squirrel court,' 'more cowbell') are omitted, but this is intentional to maintain brevity while preserving critical technical information."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary comprehensively covers all major sections of the original text. It includes safety, compliance, quality, efficiency, automated metrics, LLM-as-a-judge, nuanced capabilities (personalization, planning, feedback), intrinsic/extrinsic evaluation, bias, reliability, efficiency/cost, observability, and user satisfaction. While it omits some specific anecdotes (e.g., 'Franken-Rig,' 'squirrel-adjacent intro'), these are not essential to the technical evaluation framework described. All critical concepts and methodologies from the original are represented without omission or distortion."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is a flawless, coherent, and concise representation of the original text. It accurately captures all technical evaluation criteria, methodologies, and their importance without adding or omitting critical information. The structure mirrors the original's logical flow, and the language is precise and professional. It successfully distills the article's complex ideas into a clear, actionable overview while maintaining fidelity to the source material."
