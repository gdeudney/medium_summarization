New findings from NASA's Curiosity Rover in Gale Crater reveal that Mars experienced significant water activity, including ancient megafloods triggered by meteor impacts around 4 billion years ago and long-lasting lakes and river systems spanning millions of years. Analysis of sediment layers confirms intense flooding events, supporting the hypothesis that early Mars had a thicker atmosphere and conditions capable of sustaining liquid water, which enhances understanding of the planet's past habitability.
