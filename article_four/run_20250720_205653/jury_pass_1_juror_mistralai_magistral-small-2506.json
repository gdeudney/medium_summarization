  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key points from the source text, including the evidence of ancient megafloods, long-lasting lakes and river systems, and the hypothesis about Mars' thicker atmosphere and liquid water. However, it slightly conflates the meteor impact trigger (from Article 1) with the broader geological context (from Articles 2 and 3), which could be seen as a minor oversimplification."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is well-structured, logically flowing, and easy to understand. It effectively combines information from multiple articles into a coherent narrative without losing clarity."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary is reasonably concise, avoiding unnecessary fluff. However, it could be slightly more direct by removing minor redundancies (e.g., 'significant water activity' and 'intense flooding events' overlap in meaning)."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures all critical points from the source text, including the megafloods, long-lasting water bodies, sediment analysis, and implications for Mars' past habitability. No major omissions or misrepresentations are present."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is highly accurate, well-structured, and comprehensive, with only minor room for improvement in conciseness. It effectively distills the essential information from the source text while maintaining clarity and coherence."
