{
  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core arguments and examples from the original, such as the importance of safety (e.g., avoiding dangerous hallucinations), compliance risks, and the role of automated vs. human evaluation. It retains key metaphors (e.g., 'raft to cross the Atlantic') and maintains the original's tone—humorous yet urgent. However, it slightly simplifies some nuanced points (e.g., the 'sibling AI' analogy dilutes the technical discussion of LLM-as-a-judge)."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is logically structured, with clear sections (e.g., 'Why Evaluation Isn’t Optional', 'How to Spot a Genius') that mirror the original’s flow. Transitions between ideas are smooth, and the argument builds toward a decisive conclusion. The tone remains consistent, balancing urgency with approachability, and avoids jargon."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively condenses complex topics (e.g., intrinsic/extrinsic evaluation) into digestible bullet points and analogies. It avoids redundancy and cuts fluff while preserving the original’s depth. Minor trims could improve conciseness (e.g., the haiku metaphor appears twice)."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all critical points: safety, compliance, quality, metrics (automated/human), and hidden risks (bias, cost, user satisfaction). It omits minor tangents (e.g., temperature settings, Chain-of-Thought) but focuses on the most actionable insights."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellent—faithful, coherent, and concise—but could tighten word choice and reduce repetition for a perfect 5/5. It succeeds in making a technical topic accessible without oversimplifying."
