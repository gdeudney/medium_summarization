{
  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 3,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures many core ideas—planning evaluation, explainability, human evaluation, intrinsic/extrinsic distinctions, bias, reliability, efficiency, observability, and user satisfaction—but omits several important sections from the source such as detailed metric descriptions (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore, perplexity), the discussion of safety and regulatory compliance, the \"LLM-as-a-judge\" methodology, and some contextual narrative. Thus it is partially faithful but not fully."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is well‑structured, logically ordered, and easy to follow; each point flows naturally into the next without abrupt jumps or confusing phrasing."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "It removes much of the source’s informal tone and extraneous anecdotes while retaining key concepts. Some repetition occurs (e.g., bias/fairness mentioned twice), but overall it is succinct relative to the original text."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 3,
    "reasoning": "While many major themes are present, several critical elements—specific metric names, safety/regulatory discussion, LLM-as-a-judge details, and some contextual framing—are missing. Thus coverage is incomplete."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary provides a coherent, reasonably concise overview that captures the main thrust of the source but falls short on full faithfulness and comprehensive coverage of all key points."
