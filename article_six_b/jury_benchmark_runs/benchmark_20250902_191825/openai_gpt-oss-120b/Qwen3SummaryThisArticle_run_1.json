{
  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the main ideas of the source article and does not introduce factual errors, though it omits some specific examples and nuances (e.g., detailed discussion of BLEU/ROUGE, LLM-as-a-judge, safety/legal compliance)."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is well‑structured, flows logically from one point to the next, and uses clear language without confusing or contradictory statements."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "It conveys the essential information in a compact form, avoiding unnecessary filler, though it remains somewhat lengthy due to enumerating many sub‑points."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures most of the critical sections (planning, explainability, human evaluation, intrinsic vs extrinsic, bias, reliability, efficiency, observability, user satisfaction, conclusion) but leaves out several notable topics such as automated metric details, LLM‑as‑judge methodology, and regulatory/compliance motivations."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is a faithful, coherent, and mostly concise representation of the original article, covering the majority of its key points while missing some ancillary details. It would be rated strong overall with minor room for improvement in completeness and brevity."
