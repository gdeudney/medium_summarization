  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the main arguments and facts from the source article without introducing incorrect information. It captures the core reasons for evaluation and the primary categories of methods, but it omits several nuanced points (e.g., specific discussion of planning, refinement on feedback, chain‑of‑thought explainability) that are present in the original."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is well‑structured, flows logically, and uses clear language. Each bullet point builds on the previous one, making it easy to understand the overall message."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary conveys the essential information in a compact form without unnecessary filler or repetition. It stays focused on the key take‑aways."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "Most of the critical topics from the source are covered: why evaluation matters, automated metrics, LLM‑as‑judge, human evaluation, intrinsic vs extrinsic, and broader considerations like bias, reliability, cost, observability, and user satisfaction. However, it leaves out several specific sub‑topics (e.g., planning & sequencing metrics, feedback refinement, explainability techniques such as chain‑of‑thought, and the distinction between intrinsic/extrinsic evaluation examples), so coverage is strong but not exhaustive."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary provides a faithful, coherent, and concise representation of the original article's main points. While it captures the majority of the content, a few detailed aspects are omitted, resulting in slightly lower coverage than perfect."
