  "coverage": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "It covers the majority of critical topics: why evaluation matters, automated metrics, LLM‑as‑judge, human evaluation, nuanced capabilities, explainability, intrinsic vs. extrinsic evaluation, and additional considerations like bias, reliability, cost, observability, and user satisfaction. Some peripheral points from the source (e.g., specific safety anecdotes, regulatory phrasing, non‑deterministic testing nuances) are not fully captured."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is a faithful, coherent, and fairly concise representation of the original article, capturing most of its key sections while missing some finer details. It would be rated as strong overall with minor room for improvement in completeness and brevity."
