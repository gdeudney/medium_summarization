  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures all key technical concepts (e.g., HTD, BERTScore, intrinsic/extrinsic evaluation) without inventing facts. It aligns precisely with the source's structure and core arguments about LLM evaluation methods."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary is logically organized but lacks the original's distinctive tone (humor, colloquial references to 'Franken-Lab' or squirrels). While technically coherent, it misses the creative media elements that gave the source its personality."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary eliminates redundant examples and streamlines explanations while retaining all essential information. Every sentence serves a clear purpose without fluff."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "All major evaluation categories (planning refinement, explainability, human assessment) are included, but some nuanced details like 'Recursive Thought Expansion' or specific compliance examples from the source are omitted for brevity."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is a technically accurate and concise distillation of the hybrid source text. It succeeds in capturing factual content with precision but sacrifices the original's narrative flair, which slightly reduces its holistic effectiveness as a true 'soulful' representation."
