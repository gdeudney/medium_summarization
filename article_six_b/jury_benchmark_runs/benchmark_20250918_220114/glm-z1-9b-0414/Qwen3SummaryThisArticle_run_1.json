{
  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the source text without inventing facts. It covers key points like evaluation metrics (e.g., HTD, METEOR), explainability, human evaluation, and intrinsic/extrinsic methods. However, some nuances (e.g., specific case studies) are condensed into bullet points, slightly reducing fidelity to the source's technical depth."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary maintains logical flow from core metrics to broader considerations (bias, efficiency). Transitions between sections are clear but occasionally abrupt. For a Technical Document, this is acceptable as it prioritizes factual accuracy over narrative style."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "Every word serves the purpose of summarizing the source. Complex topics (e.g., recursive thought expansion) are distilled into concise bullet points without omitting critical information. No redundancy or fluff is present."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "Covers both technical aspects (e.g., METEOR, BERTScore) and practical considerations (bias, efficiency). However, some detailed examples from the source (e.g., specific regulatory requirements) are omitted in favor of high-level categorization. This aligns with Technical Document goals but sacrifices some granular detail."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is a strong Technical Document summary. It achieves high faithfulness and conciseness, with thorough coverage of core evaluation metrics and methodologies. Coherence is slightly impacted by abrupt transitions but remains acceptable for its purpose. The final score reflects excellence in accuracy and utility, with minor room for enhanced detail."
