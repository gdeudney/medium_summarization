{
  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects all key points and metrics from the Technical Document without inventing facts. It maintains factual integrity while condensing complex topics."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is logically structured, transitioning smoothly between core evaluation pillars (e.g., intrinsic/extrinsic) and additional considerations (bias, efficiency). Technical terms are contextualized without sacrificing clarity."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "Balances brevity with completeness. Each bullet point is succinct, avoiding redundancy while retaining critical details like HTD, METEOR, and human evaluation. The conclusion effectively synthesizes the content."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "Comprehensively covers all major sections of the Technical Document: planning/refinement, explainability, human evaluation, intrinsic/extrinsic metrics, and extended aspects (bias, efficiency). Omissions are minor (e.g., humor examples) but do not impact core accuracy."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary excels as a Technical Document overview. It maintains faithfulness to the source's technical depth, ensures coherence through logical flow, achieves conciseness without omitting critical data, and thoroughly covers all evaluation pillars. Minor omissions of illustrative examples do not detract from its utility for practitioners."
