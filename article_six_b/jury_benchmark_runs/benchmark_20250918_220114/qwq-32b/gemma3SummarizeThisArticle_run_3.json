  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects all key points from the Hybrid source: technical metrics (BLEU/ROUGE), safety/compliance focus, and the conversational tone. No invented facts; it stays true to both factual content and thematic intent."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary is logically structured but lacks some of the source's creative metaphors (e.g., 'digital gremlins'). It maintains clarity and flows well for a Hybrid text, though it slightly underrepresents the original's narrative style."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "Every sentence serves a purpose. The summary efficiently condenses complex evaluation concepts without redundancy or unnecessary details, meeting the Hybrid source's need for both brevity and factual precision."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "Covers core topics (metrics, safety, compliance) but omits some nuances like METEOR's contextual understanding or specific examples of bias. Still captures essential elements required by the Hybrid source's blend of technical and explanatory content."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is a strong, faithful distillation of the Hybrid source text. It excels in factual accuracy (Faithfulness) and conciseness while maintaining logical flow (Coherence). Minor deductions for slight underrepresentation of creative elements and omission of specific details, but overall it effectively balances technical rigor with thematic intent."
