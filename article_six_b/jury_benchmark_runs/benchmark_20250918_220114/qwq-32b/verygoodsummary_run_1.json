  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects all key facts, technical terms (e.g., RTE/HTD/BERTScore), references (ArXiv paper), and even preserves specific stylistic flourishes like 'Digital Darwin Awards' without inventing or omitting critical details."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary maintains the original's hybrid structure: technical rigor in metrics/methods sections is paired with preserved humor (e.g., 'biking to the moon,' 'more cowbell') and analogies. The logical flow mirrors the source's organization, ensuring readability while retaining its conversational tone."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "Every section distills dense content into concise bullet points without sacrificing essential information. Technical terms are retained where necessary (e.g., 'temperature' for non-determinism), and redundant examples from the source are streamlined while preserving core arguments."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures all major sections of the original: evaluation motivations, automated metrics, LLM-as-judge methods, nuanced capabilities (planning/sentiment/refinement), explainability, human evaluation, intrinsic/extrinsic distinctions, bias/fairness, reliability, efficiency, observability, and user satisfaction. Even stylistic elements like recurring coffee break jokes are preserved."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary achieves a near-perfect balance for the Hybrid source type: it maintains technical accuracy (critical for a 'Technical Document') while preserving the original's creative voice and narrative style ('Creative Media' soul). It excels in all four pillars, making it an exemplary model of hybrid content summarization."
