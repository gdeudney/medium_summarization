  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the original article’s claims without adding invented facts. All quoted examples, safety concerns, regulatory points, and metric descriptions are present and correctly paraphrased."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The text flows logically, mirroring the source’s structure (why evaluate, automated metrics, LLM‑as‑judge, nuanced capabilities, explainability, human eval, intrinsic vs extrinsic, beyond core metrics). The humorous tone is preserved, making it readable and cohesive."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "While the summary condenses a lengthy article into ~800 words and omits many peripheral jokes, it still includes most major sections. Given the depth of the source, the length is reasonable but could be trimmed further."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary touches on every major topic from the original: safety/compliance motivations, all listed automated metrics (accuracy, F1, BLEU/ROUGE, METEOR, Perplexity, BERTScore), LLM‑as‑judge methods, personalization, planning (RTE/HTD), feedback refinement, explainability, human evaluation, intrinsic vs extrinsic evaluation, bias, reliability, non‑determinism, efficiency/cost, observability, and user satisfaction."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is a faithful, well‑structured, and largely concise representation of the original hybrid article, capturing both its technical substance and distinctive voice. It earns high marks across all pillars, with only minor room for tighter brevity."
