  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the original article without introducing any facts that are not present. All mentioned points (planning/HTD, explainability, human evaluation, intrinsic vs extrinsic, bias/fairness, reliability, efficiency, observability, user satisfaction) are supported by the source."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is well‑structured, flows logically from one idea to the next, and reads as a cohesive paragraph. Even though the original uses a playful voice, the summary maintains clear, readable prose appropriate for a hybrid source."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "It condenses a lengthy, detailed article into a compact set of bullet‑style points, omitting unnecessary filler while preserving essential meaning."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the majority of the major themes—evaluation categories, explainability, human judgment, intrinsic/extrinsic distinction, and ethical/operational concerns. However, it leaves out specific discussion of automated metrics (accuracy, F1, BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, Perplexity, BERTScore) and the LLM‑as‑judge methodology, so coverage is strong but not exhaustive."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "Overall, the summary is a faithful, coherent, and concise representation of the original hybrid article. It covers most of the key ideas, though it omits some detailed metric discussions, resulting in a slightly reduced coverage score. Nonetheless, it serves as an effective high‑level recap for readers."
