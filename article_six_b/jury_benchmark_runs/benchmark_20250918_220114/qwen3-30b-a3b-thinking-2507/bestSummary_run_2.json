  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately preserves all core technical claims (e.g., safety risks like 'swim the Atlantic on a raft', compliance requirements, metric definitions) and replicates the source's distinctive voice through identical humor ('Digital Darwin Awards', 'cowbell-obsessed lunatic', 'spaghetti vs. stomachs dilemma'). No facts are invented or distorted—every reference (ArXiv paper, RTE/HTD methods, temperature settings) is correctly represented with the original's playful tone intact."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary perfectly mirrors the source's narrative flow and conversational cadence. Headings ('Why Bother?', 'Beyond Core Metrics') echo the original's structure while injecting its signature humor ('logical robot presiding over squirrel court'). It avoids robotic phrasing by maintaining the source's meta-commentary style (e.g., 'metrics can’t tell you if users find outputs frustrating unless you ask'), making it feel like a natural extension of the author's voice rather than a dry recap."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "Every sentence serves dual purpose: conveying technical content (e.g., 'BERTScore uses contextual embeddings to catch paraphrases') while preserving humor ('BLEU high' instead of lengthy metric explanation). The summary eliminates redundancies from the source (e.g., condensed safety/compliance arguments) without losing nuance, hitting 800 words with zero wasted phrasing—exactly matching the source's 'coffee-break-friendly' efficiency."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary comprehensively covers all Hybrid-critical elements: technical metrics (BLEU/ROUGE, METEOR), methodologies (LLM-as-a-judge, intrinsic/extrinsic evaluation), and the source's unique perspective ('squirrel court', 'non-deterministic tantrum'). It includes every key section (bias, reliability, observability) while preserving the original's thematic throughline: evaluation as non-negotiable for safety AND soul. No critical nuance is omitted—e.g., the 'spaghetti' metaphor and ArXiv paper reference are retained verbatim."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "A near-perfect Hybrid summary that achieves technical precision while embodying the source's irreverent, narrative-driven spirit. It distills complex evaluation concepts into a cohesive, humorous piece that reads like an organic continuation of the original—proving rigorous metrics and human-centric storytelling can coexist without compromise."
