{
  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects all key points without inventing facts or distorting meaning. It correctly captures nuanced examples from the source (e.g., feedback refinement switching from 'private jet' to budget travel, bias in travel recommendations), technical terms (HTD, Chain-of-Thought), and core arguments about evaluation necessity. No factual additions or misrepresentations are present."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 3,
    "reasoning": "While logically structured as a dry technical summary, it fails to capture the source's vibrant Creative Media soul. The original used humor ('squirrel-powered centrifuge', 'more cowbell'), metaphors ('digital Darwin Awards'), and conversational energy to convey its theme. This summary reads like a clinical report, omitting all stylistic elements that made the source engaging—directly violating Creative Media's coherence requirement to recreate tone/vibe."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "Every word serves purpose; no redundancies or fluff. It efficiently distills complex concepts (e.g., 'non-deterministic tantrum' condensed to 'varying answers requiring repeated testing') without sacrificing clarity, meeting conciseness standards for any text type."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "All major sections are comprehensively covered: planning/refinement (HTD), explainability (Chain-of-Thought limitations), human evaluation's role in detecting bias/nuance, intrinsic/extrinsic distinction, and all 'beyond core metrics' aspects (bias, reliability, efficiency, observability). The summary includes the source's critical nuance about combining methods for safety/user-centricity."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary excels in faithfulness and coverage but fails coherence by omitting the source's essential Creative Media soul. It delivers a technically accurate dry report instead of mirroring the original's engaging, humorous tone—making it feel like a technical document summary rather than a reflection of the vibrant source."
