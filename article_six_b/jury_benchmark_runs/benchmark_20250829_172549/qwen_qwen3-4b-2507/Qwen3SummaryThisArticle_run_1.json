  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects all key points from the original source text. It correctly identifies HTD and RTE for planning evaluation, accurately describes feedback refinement, properly captures explainability techniques like Chain-of-Thought and input attribution, and includes all major evaluation aspects such as bias, reliability, efficiency, observability, and user satisfaction. It also correctly presents intrinsic vs. extrinsic evaluation and the conclusion about a robust, multi-faceted evaluation strategy. No factual omissions or distortions are present."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is logically structured, with clear thematic progression from planning and refinement to explainability, human evaluation, intrinsic/extrinsic frameworks, and broader considerations. Each section flows naturally into the next, using consistent terminology and a professional yet accessible tone. The language is precise, well-organized, and maintains a coherent narrative arc throughout, making complex concepts easy to follow without sacrificing depth."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is highly succinct, distilling a dense, multi-sectioned article into a focused, point-by-point overview without adding fluff or redundancy. It eliminates verbose examples, anecdotes, and stylistic elements (like references to squirrels or coffee breaks) while preserving all critical information. Every sentence serves a distinct purpose, and the structure ensures maximum information density with minimal word count."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary comprehensively captures all major evaluation dimensions discussed in the original text: planning and refinement, explainability, human evaluation, intrinsic/extrinsic frameworks, bias, reliability, efficiency, observability, user satisfaction, and the conclusion about a holistic evaluation strategy. It does not miss any of the core sub-topics or nuanced points, including the non-deterministic behavior of LLMs and the limitations of automated metrics. All critical aspects are represented with appropriate detail and accuracy."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is exceptionally faithful, coherent, concise, and comprehensive. It provides a perfectly balanced, accurate, and well-structured representation of the original source text, meeting all evaluation criteria at the highest level without any compromise or omission."
