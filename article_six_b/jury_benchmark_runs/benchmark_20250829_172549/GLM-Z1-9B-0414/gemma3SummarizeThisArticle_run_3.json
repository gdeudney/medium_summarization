  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the source text's core messages on evaluation importance, methods (automated metrics, LLM judges, human evaluation), and key considerations (bias, reliability, non-determinism). However, it omits specific examples (e.g., ArXiv paper, squirrel metaphors) and nuanced details (e.g., METEOR/BERTScore depth), slightly reducing factual completeness."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary logically structures the evaluation process from 'why' to 'how,' with clear sections on methods and considerations. Transitions between automated metrics and LLM judges feel abrupt, but overall flow is intuitive and aligns with the source's narrative."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "Effectively condenses the source's extensive content into a concise format using bullet points and headings. Some sections (e.g., non-determinism) are brief compared to the source but maintain essential information without redundancy."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "Covers all major topics (safety, compliance, metrics, human evaluation, bias, etc.) but misses specific examples and deeper dives from the source. Core points are preserved, though some context is simplified."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is a strong, accurate distillation of the original text's key themes and methodologies for evaluating LLMs. While it sacrifices some granular details (e.g., case studies, technical metrics), its structure and coverage make it accessible and实用 for readers seeking a high-level overview."
