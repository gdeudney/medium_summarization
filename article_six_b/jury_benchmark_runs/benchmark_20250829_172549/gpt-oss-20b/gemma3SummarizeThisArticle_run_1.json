  "faithfulness": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the core themes of the source—importance of evaluation, key methods (automated metrics, LLM-as-judge, human evaluation), intrinsic/extrinsic distinction, and considerations like bias, reliability, cost, observability, user satisfaction, and non‑determinism. However it omits many specifics such as the exact metric names (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore), detailed explanations of each metric, discussions on planning, personalization, explainability techniques, and some contextual humor from the original text. Thus it is factually correct but not exhaustive."
  },
  "coherence": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary flows logically, with clear sections that mirror the source structure. Sentences are well‑formed and easy to follow."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "rank": 5,
    "reasoning": "It removes extraneous detail while preserving essential points; no fluff or redundancy is present."
  },
  "coverage": {
    "rank": 4,
    "reasoning": "While it captures all major ideas, it leaves out several important details (specific metric names, deeper explanations of planning and personalization, etc.), so coverage is strong but not complete."
  },
  "overall_assessment": "The summary provides a faithful, coherent, concise overview that covers the main arguments of the source text, though it omits some detailed points."
